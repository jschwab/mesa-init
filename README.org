* MESA Init Scripts
These scripts simplify the management of environment variables related
to [[http://mesa.sourceforge.net][MESA]] and the [[http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~townsend/static.php?ref%3Dmesasdk][MESA SDK]].  They should be particularly useful for
users who run multiple MESA versions or use non-SDK compilers as part
of other work.

These scripts are designed to work with the bash shell.  They also
assume you have python3 installed.

** Installation and Setup
Clone this git repository
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
git clone https://github.com/jschwab/mesa-init.git
#+END_EXAMPLE

Create a file named =.mesa_init= in your home directory.  List the
paths to your various MESA versions using [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file][ini]] format, as below.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  [svn]
      MESA_DIR = /path/to/mesa

  [r5118]
      MESA_DIR = /path/to/mesa-r5118

  [r6794]
      MESA_DIR = /path/to/mesa-r6794

  [r7184]
      MESA_DIR = /path/to/mesa-r7184
#+END_EXAMPLE

You can use whatever names in the square braces that you desire.  That
will be your shorthand to refer to that particular version.  Instead
of version numbers, you might want to use descriptors associated with
the particular project you are doing with that version.

Now, add the following lines to your =.bashrc=.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  # set the MESA and MESA SDK paths
  export MESA_DIR=/path/to/mesa
  export MESASDK_ROOT=/path/to/mesasdk

  # source the mesa init script
  source /path/to/mesa-init/mesa_init.sh

  # add a command to activate the SDK
  activatemesasdk () {
      source /path/to/mesa-init/mesasdk_init.sh
  }

  # if you want, you can call it now.  I call it manually,
  # since I only want the SDK active sometimes

  # activatemesasdk

  # __mesa_ps1 shows the MESA and MESA SDK status.
  # you can use it in your bash prompt.  my PS1 looks like

  # PS1='$(__mesa_ps1)\h: \W$ '

#+END_EXAMPLE

** Usage with MESA
There is now a function =chmesadir= defined in your environment, which
allows you to switch between the MESA versions you listed in
=.mesa_init=. The function provides completion information, so you can
hit tab to see or complete your options.

When you invoke it, it will change the =MESA_DIR= environment variable
and update the variables controlling the MESA-related information
displayed in your prompt.

** Usage with MESA SDK
If you followed the above instructions, you defined an
=activatemesasdk= function.  Issuing this command will add the SDK to
your system paths.

When you activate the SDK, it defines a =deactivatemesasdk= command
function.  Issuing this command will remove the SDK from your system
paths.
