* MESA SDK Init Scripts
These scripts are drop-in replacements for the initialization scripts
provided by the [[http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~townsend/static.php?ref%3Dmesasdk][MESA SDK]].  They are useful if you frequently use
non-SDK compilers as part of other work.
** Installation
You can overwrite the files that come with the SDK.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
cp mesasdk_init.csh $MESASDK_ROOT/bin
cp mesasdk_init.sh $MESASDK_ROOT/bin
#+END_EXAMPLE
** Usage
*** Turn on the SDK
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
activatemesasdk
#+END_EXAMPLE

By default this will prepend "[mesasdk]" to your command prompt to
remind you that the SDK is active.  If you don't wish this to occur,
set the variable
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
MESASDK_DISABLE_PROMPT=t
#+END_EXAMPLE
in your shell.

*** Turn off the SDK
When you activate the SDK, it makes the following command available.
Issuing it removes the SDK from your system paths.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
deactivatemesasdk
#+END_EXAMPLE
